On what is becoming a more normal event on a Friday evening, one of our kids had a significant other joining us for dinner; something I very much encourage allowing me to better know the person my teens are growing close to. This evening we were joined by my daughter's boyfriend, a little quiet from the newness of the experience but overall he seems like a fine young man.

During our pizza dinner there was the expected table banter

. What did you get for Christmas, have you seen the new Star Wars movie, etc. On my third pizza slice, as dinner was winding down, the pepperoni pizza took over. My normally functioning mind to mouth filer completely shut down; undoubtedly due to lack of blood flow. And out it came, "So, have you kissed my daughter yet?" Needless to say the conversation around the table came to a complete halt. I was further surprised by how quickly I found myself alone at the table.

I have gotten looks from my wife for over 25 years, and now with a teen daughter and on this occasion, I got the coldest glares, insinuating my demise was being planned, in stereo.

So, if ever you find yourself eating pepperoni pizza in a group, keep in mind that it has now been scientifically proven that it is a known "Mind to Mouth Filter" inhibiter.
